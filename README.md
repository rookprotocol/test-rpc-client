# Test RPC Client
Convenience functions for sending test eth RPC calls.

Eventually this may become a client class, but for now it's just functions.


# How to use

Made a `.env` file:
```
ADDRESS=<your EOA checksum address>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your EOA private key>
PROVIDER=<an eth RPC provider url, such as an infura node>
```

Do NOT commit any private keys to this repo.
